# To see all resources that exist in kubernetes
kubectl api-resources

# Show the full yaml of a deployment including defaults
kubectl get deploy events-web -o yaml

# Store a deployment with all settings into a yaml-file (I guess this is more portable)
kubectl get deploy events-web -o yaml > demo.yaml

Question: the rollout command keeps a copy of the deployment.yaml that was running before the kubectl -f apply?

Question: where does the minikube tunnel go?
